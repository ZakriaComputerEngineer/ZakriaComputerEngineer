Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and turning innovative ideas into reality. With a diverse skill set and a love for tackling complex challenges.

1) Machine Learning and Deep Learning: From predictive analytics to computer vision, I excel in developing intelligent systems that learn and adapt and develop cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models.

2) Computer Vision: Computer vision models, augmentation, filtering, data cleaning, feature engineering & selection techniques.

3) Autonomous Vehicles: Decision making pipelines for autonomous vehicles with multi-model threadings, LiDaR based detections and tracking, camera based road segmentation, reinforced learning, control systems etc in real-time on edge devices.

4) Embedded Devices: Nvidia jetson series, Raspberry pi series, ESP, Arduino etc.

5) FPGA HDL Coding: Development of own computer chips like ASICs, floating point processors, tensor processors etc on verilog.

6) Advanced Python and C++ Projects: From algorithmic optimizations to system-level programming, I tackle projects with precision and depth.

7) Basic Chip Design (Pipelined and Parallel) in Xilinx: My experience extends to chip design, where I specialize in creating efficient and optimized designs using Xilinx tools.
